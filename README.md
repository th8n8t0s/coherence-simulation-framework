# coherence-simulation-framework
This project explores how static geometric fields—such as spirals, arcs, and dual-core shapes—can influence entropy and curvature in scalar signal propagation. The framework simulates energy-like signals diffusing through these geometries and tracks how coherence, structure, and information density evolve over time.
